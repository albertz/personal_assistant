For all personal data:
	Sync across systems.

Intelligent syncing :=
	Keep track over changes,
	apply changes everywhere (sync),
	every systems can have an own set of files, i.e. it must not have everything,
	if we delete something, that can have different meanings:
		1. delete globally, including history, (to save global space)
		2. delete globally but keep in history, (cleanup)
		3. delete locally and be sure that there exists backups at other places (to clean up the disk and save space on smaller systems)
	know about (roughly) how much backups we have of one file/dir,
	
That intelligent syncing would just be the same for music, projects, videos, pictures and documents.

Git would be a very nice system for keeping track over changes. Problems are though:
	1. We always must have all files. (I.e. not possible to just keep some.)
	2. We can either delete the whole history or not. (So not possible to delete the history of one single directory or so.)
Possible work arounds: Sub modules. So just a separate Git repo for everything.

So, let's each entity (e.g. a single project or a pictures directory or a single music album directory) be a separate Git (or whatever) repo.
